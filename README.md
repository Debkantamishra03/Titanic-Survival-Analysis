# Titanic Survival Data Analysis 

The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used to understand survival factors during the disaster. Our goal was to identify which passenger features influenced survival rates.

## Project Overview
  1. Data Cleaning
     - Dropped irrelevant columns (`Name`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`, `SibSp`, `Parch`).
     - Handled missing values in `Age`.
  
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis
     - Gender and survival
     - Age and survival
     - Fare and survival
  
  3. Visualization
     - Survival distributions across gender, age groups, and fare ranges.
